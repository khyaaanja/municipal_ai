"""Lexical retrieval over KnowledgeChunk.

Replaces substring matching, which could only ever return a chunk that
contained the query verbatim. A citizen asking "कर कसरी तिर्ने?" shares no
substring with a chunk titled "Property Tax Payment", so icontains returned
nothing however good the content was.

Scoring is BM25-style term overlap over a Devanagari-aware tokeniser, with a
small bilingual term map so a Nepali query can reach English content and the
reverse. No external service and no embedding model: it runs offline, in the
test suite, and on shared hosting.
